# Origami Studio

This prototype is a simple Electron application that, when run, shows a window saying "Hello, world!"

## Architecture

- The HTML for the window is completely vanilla HTML and has no CSS or JavaScript.
- Beyond the necessary dependencies for Electron, this project has no other dependencies.

## Basic application behavior

- When the last application window closes, the application exits.
